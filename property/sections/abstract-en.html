<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Property module of the Hydrogen Valley Ontology models a set of static and dynamic properties associated with the Components of an Hydrogen Valley, and links them with their applicable Unit of measure and QuantityKind. It reuses the QUDT ontology and vocabularies.

For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305).
