# Hydrogen Valley Ontology (H2V)

This repository hosts the Hydrogen Valley Ontology (H2V) and its related module Property (H2V-Property).

| Prefix    | IRI |
| -- | ------- |
| h2v:  | [https://w3id.org/h2v#](https://w3id.org/h2v#)  |
| h2v-prop:  | [https://w3id.org/h2v/property#](https://w3id.org/h2v/property#)  |

## Ontology purpose and scope

The Hydrogen Valley Ontology (H2V) addresses the Hydrogen Valley (HV) domain, and models the Hydrogen Valley and its Sub-Systems, as Hydrogen Valley Areas and Components (electrolyzer, hydrogen storage, etc.), and their topology. 

It allows to link a specific HV System to its Static (i.e., nominal and defined by design) and Dynamic (i.e., observable and measured at some point in time) Properties. 

It also models relevant activities like Weather Forecast, Hydrogen Allocation and Hydrogen Export/Import, and resources like the technical drawing that graphically represents the HV.

H2V reuses state-of-the-art ontologies including SSN (Semantic Sensor Network), SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator), SAREF, GeoSPARQL, and QUDT. 

For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305).

## Content of the repository

The requirements collected for developing the ontology are available in the `requirements` folder.

The RDF files of the two ontology modules, along with the documentation generated by the Widoco tool and by reusing this template repository https://github.com/cefriel/ontology-template, can be found in the folders `h2v` and `property`.
