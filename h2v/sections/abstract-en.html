<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Hydrogen Valley Ontology (H2V) addresses the Hydrogen Valley (HV) domain, and models the Hydrogen Valley and its Sub-Systems, as Hydrogen Valley Areas and Components (electrolyzer, hydrogen storage, etc.). 

It allows to link a specific HV System to its Static (i.e., nominal and defined by design) and Dynamic (i.e., observable and measured at some point in time) Properties. 

It also models relevant activities like Weather Forecast, Hydrogen Allocation and Hydrogen Export/Import, and relevant resources like the technical drawing of a Hydrogen Valley. 

H2V reuses state-of-the-art ontologies including SSN (Semantic Sensor Network), SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator), SAREF, GeoSPARQL, and QUDT. 

For designing the ontology, we adopted the [Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology](https://zenodo.org/records/2539305).</span>
